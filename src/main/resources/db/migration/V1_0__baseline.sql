-- Baseline schema for existing tables

-- This is a placeholder to establish a baseline version
-- The actual tables already exist in the database
-- Flyway will mark this migration as applied without executing it

-- Note: This file is intentionally empty as we're using baseline-on-migrate=true
-- to tell Flyway that the existing schema should be treated as the baseline.
